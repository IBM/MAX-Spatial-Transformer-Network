# IBM Code Model Asset Exchange: </br> Spatial Transformer Network

This repository contains code to train and score a Spatial Transformer Network on the [IBM Watson Machine Learning](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/machine-learning), from the IBM Code Model Asset Exchange.

> Spatial Transformer Network allows the spatial manipulation of data within the network.

# Quickstart

## Prerequisites

* This experiment requires a provisioned instance of IBM Watson Machine Learning service.

### Setup an IBM Cloud Object Storage (COS) account
- Create an IBM Cloud Object Storage account if you don't have one (https://www.ibm.com/cloud/storage)
- Create credentials for either reading and writing or just reading
	- From the bluemix console page (https://console.bluemix.net/dashboard/apps/), choose `Cloud Object Storage`
	- On the left side, click the `service credentials`
	- Click on the `new credentials` button to create new credentials
	- In the 'Add New Credentials' popup, use this parameter `{"HMAC":true}` in the `Add Inline Configuration...`
	- When you create the credentials, copy the `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` values.
	- Make a note of the endpoint url
		- On the left side of the window, click on `Endpoint`
		- Copy the relevant public or private endpoint. [I choose the us-geo private endpoint].
- In addition setup your [AWS S3 command line](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) which can be used to create buckets and/or add files to COS.
 Â  - Export `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` with your COS `access_key_id` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` with your COS `secret_access_key`

### Setup IBM CLI & ML CLI

- Install [IBM Cloud CLI](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/cli/reference/bluemix_cli/get_started.html#getting-started)
  - Login using `bx login` or `bx login --sso` if within IBM
- Install [ML CLI Plugin](https://dataplatform.ibm.com/docs/content/analyze-data/ml_dlaas_environment.html)
  - After install, check if there is any plugins that need update
    - `bx plugin update`
  - Make sure to setup the various environment variables correctly:
    - `ML_INSTANCE`, `ML_USERNAME`, `ML_PASSWORD`, `ML_ENV`

## Training the model

The `train.sh` utility script will deploy the experiment to WML and start the training as a `training-run`

```
train.sh
```

After the train is started, it should print the training-id that is going to be necessary for steps below

```
Starting to train ...
OK
Model-ID is 'training-GCtN_YRig'
```

### Monitor the  training run

- To list the training runs - `bx ml list training-runs`
- To monitor a specific training run - `bx ml show training-runs <training-id>`
- To monitor the output (stdout) from the training run - `bx ml monitor training-runs <training-id>`
	- This will print the first couple of lines, and may time out.


### Save and deploy the model after completion

Save the model, when the training run has successfully completed and deploy it for scoring.
- `bx ml store training-runs <training-id>`
	- This should give you back a *model-id*
- `bx ml deploy <model-id> 'spatial-training-deployment'`
	- This should give you a *deployment-id*

## Scoring the model

- Update `modelId` and `deploymentId` on `scoring-payload.json`
- Score the model with `bx ml score scoring-payload.json`

```
bx ml score scoring-payload.json
Fetching scoring results for the deployment '14f98de1-bc60-4ece-b9f2-3e0c1528c778' ...
{"values": [1]}

OK
Score request successful
```
